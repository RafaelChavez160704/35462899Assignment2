<h1>Assignment 2: Cloud Project & Video Explainer</h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For this assignment, I plan to create a professional online portfolio to showcase all my graphic design projects in a portfolio website using Amazon EC2 as IaaS, share each of their respective creative processes and reflect on them. For context, before studying my Bachelor of Information Technology at Murdoch University, I completed a Certificate III, IV, and a Diploma of Graphic Design at North Metropolitan TAFE. Over those years, I created a wide range of design projects, such as logotypes, branding packages and identities, mockup websites, magazine and book covers, digital illustrations, 3D models, and even animations using Adobe software like Illustrator, InDesign, PhotoShop, and AfterEffects, as well as blender, Visual Studio Code, and many others.</p>

This project will serve two main purposes: first, to present the work I developed during my graphic design studies in a cohesive and visually appealing format; and second, to demonstrate my ability to apply the technical skills gained in my IT degree so far by hosting this website on Amazon EC2, thus gaining hands hands-on experience and giving me greater control over server management, deployment, and scalability. The portfolio website will feature a home page introducing me and my creative background, a gallery section organizing my work by category (e.g., branding, typography, UI/UX, illustration), and a contact page with links to my professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) and resume. I aim to design the site with responsiveness, accessibility, and user experience in mind, showcasing both my design sensibility and growing web development skills. Ultimately, this project allows me to merge my creative foundation with my current IT studies, creating a portfolio that can be used for future job applications, freelance opportunities, or networking within both industries. It also allows me to gain practical experience working with cloud computing infrastructure and web hosting, which are crucial skills in tech landscape nowadays.
